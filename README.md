# XML-shema

This repository stores an XML schema expression of the [SEMIC specifications](https://github.com/SEMICeu#-semic-specifications).

SEMIC is mostly focused on semantic interoperability by developing, maintaining and promoting data standards and recommendations such as the Core Vocabularies, to define the meaning of data elements.

Technical interoperability involves the technical aspects of data exchange, ensuring that data can be transferred and processed correctly between systems. This is achieved through the use of standardised formats and protocols such as XML.

An XML schema defines the structure and data types of XML documents, ensuring that data exchanged between systems adheres to a predefined structure, so it is easier to validate and process the data in a consistent and accurate way.

The documentation about the structure of the XML schema can be found [here](./doc/xsd_structure.md).

The rules used to verify the XML schema can be found [here](./rules/rules_schematron.md).
