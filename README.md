# XML-shema

This repository stores an XML schema expression of the [SEMIC specifications](https://github.com/SEMICeu#-semic-specifications).

SEMIC is focused on semantic interoperability by developing, maintaining and promoting data standards and recommendations. 

Semantic interoperability involves ensuring that data exchanged between systems is understood in the same way by all parties. 
This is achieved using standardised vocabularies and schemas, such as the Core Vocabularies, to define the meaning of data elements.
The Core Vocabularies provide a standardised approach for describing key concepts such as locations, businesses, organisations and natural persons.

Technical interoperability involves the technical aspects of data exchange, ensuring that data can be transferred and processed correctly between systels.
This is achieved through the use of standardised formats and protocols.
XSD files are a war to put this technical interoperability in place.
XSD defines the structure and data types of XML documents, ensuring that data exchanged between systems adheres to a predefined format, so it is easier to validate and process the data in a consistent and accurate way.

Through an XML schema, the rules are defined to encode documents in XML, ensuring that data is consistently formatted an easily exchangeable between systems.
